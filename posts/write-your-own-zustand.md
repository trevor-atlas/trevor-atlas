Zustand is a popular state management library for React. Zustant allows you to create a global state object, and then use that state object in
your components via a hook. It's a great library, but it's also a great learning tool. In this
post, we'll write our own version of Zustand, and learn how to use Typescript to
make our code more robust.

## Setup
I used [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) to set this post up. Feel free to use whatever environment you'd like.
I'll be using Typescript for this, but you can use Javascript if you'd like.

To get us started, let's first look at a simple react application that has two form inputs.
```ts

```
