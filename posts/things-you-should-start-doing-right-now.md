## Make a playlist of your favorite songs every month

I started doing this in 2016, and now I have a catalog of every song I liked in the last 7 years.
It's simple really, just make a playlist each month, and when you hear a song that you like, add it to that months' playlist.
This also helps you discover new music (at least with spotify), you can look at any given month and see suggestions for songs you might like related to what's in that playlist.

## Write down your ideas (even the dumb ones)

This does a number of things.
- it helps you remember your ideas, you can now go back to look at them later.
- It helps you see repeat ideas, and identify patterns in thought.

If I have the same idea multiple times, I know it's something I should consider pursuing further (or consider why I keep having the same idea if it seems bad).

## Walk more

In this post 2020 world where many of us are living and working from home, it's easy to get stuck in a rut and not get out of the house.
There are less distractions, and it's easy to get sucked into things that are largely sedintary.

This is not only bad for your health, but it's also bad for your mind. Stagnation is not good for you, and has negative effects on your ability to focus, think clearly and be creative.

Walking just a few miles a day can have a huge impact on these things, and it'll help make sure you don't die as soon too!
