## Films
My favorite films of 2022 were:

#### Everything Everywhere All at Once

{% oglink url="https://letterboxd.com/film/everything-everywhere-all-at-once/" / %}

Just watch it. It's a beautiful, emotional, thought-provoking and hilarious film that I can't recommend enough.

#### Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery

{% oglink url="https://letterboxd.com/film/glass-onion-a-knives-out-mystery/" / %}

If you liked Knives Out, you'll love this. Daniel Craig's Benoit Blanc is back in full form here with a great cast and a fun story.

#### Guillermo del Toroâ€™s Pinocchio

{% oglink url="https://letterboxd.com/film/guillermo-del-toros-pinocchio/" / %}

Disclaimer: This is not for children.
It's a dark, twisted, and at times disturbing film that explores some of the darker aspects of humanity.
But it's also a beautiful film that puts a new spin on an old classic, and does it in a tasteful and thoughtful way.

#### Bullet Train

{% oglink url="https://letterboxd.com/film/bullet-train/" / %}

Brad Pitt, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Joey King star in this action-packed heist film.
Story-wise there's not much to say, but the action is fantastic and the characters are so over-the-top that it's hard not to enjoy the ride.

## TV Shows
My favorite TV shows of 2022 were:

#### The White Lotus

{% oglink url="https://www.hbo.com/the-white-lotus" / %}

I was late to the party on White Lotus, but I'm glad I finally got around to watching it.
It's a great show with an excellent cast and a compelling (if not morbid) story.

#### House of the Dragon

{% oglink url="https://www.hbo.com/house-of-the-dragon" / %}

While not as good as Game of Thrones, House of the Dragon is still an enjoyable show with many of the same elements that made GoT so incredible.
I've seen Matt Smith in quite few productions made in the last few years. He's always been great, but I think he really shines in this one.

#### Stranger Things: Season 4

{% oglink url="https://www.netflix.com/title/80057281" / %}

Nothing much to say here.
Despite some less than stellar writing in the past (looking at you [Kali Prasad](https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/Kali_Prasad)),
the show is still a blast to watch and season 4 was no exception.

#### Andor

{% oglink url="https://disneyplusoriginals.disney.com/show/andor" / %}

Andor is the single best show to come out of StarWars. Period.
It's gritty, tells an interesting story, and has a great cast of capable actors including Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd who absolutely kills it.

## Apps

### Desktop

#### Arc Browser

{% oglink url="https://arc.net/" / %}

[Invite link ðŸ‘€](https://arc.net/gift/54e94ac1)

Arc Browser is a new browser that I've been using for the past few months.
I'll be honest, it has some issues with loading and occasional bugs that require a restart of the app, but those are worth it for the other features that it offers.
Arc organizes tabs and booksmarks together in a way that makes it easy to find what you're looking for, and it makes session management so much simpler.

#### Kitty Terminal

{% oglink url="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/" title="Github" /%}

Kitty Terminal is an excellent and feature-complete terminal emulator. It's fast, customizable, and has a great set of features that I think most people expect at this point (Tabs, Split Panes, etc).
In addition to those, it also has a few features that I think are really cool, such as the ability to use unpatched fonts while still displaying [nerdfonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) correctly, and it's GPU accelerated so everything feels snappy.

#### Script Kit

{% oglink url="https://scriptkit.app/" /%}

Script Kit is a great app for automating tasks on your Mac. It's similar to Alfred or Raycast, but it's more focused on automating tasks and less on searching for things.
I think this will see a lot of growth in the coming years as more and more people start to automate their workflows and share various scripts.

## Books
I didn't read as much this year as I did in 2021, but my favorites this year were:

#### Project Hail Mary

{% oglink url="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54493401-project-hail-mary" /%}

If you like sci-fi, you'll love this book. It's a unique and compelling story that will keep you interested from start to finish.
It's rumored to be turned into a movie starring Ryan Gosling, so I'm excited to see how that turns out.

#### Plato's Republic (The Great Courses)

{% oglink url="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10434067-plato-s-republic" /%}

I've been more interested in the history of philosophy this year, and this did not dissapoint.
It's a great introduction to Plato's Republic, and it's interesting to see how the ideas in the book are largely still relevant today, despite originating from over 2000 years ago.

## Music

{% oglink url="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7AMyO1C9RppSV35a8HNDTp?si=b2013ef774094002" /%}

## Games

#### Elden Ring

{% oglink url="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/" /%}

Elden Ring is not only GOT, it's also my new favorite game of all time.
If you like Dark Souls, you'll love this game. It's a beautiful, challenging, and rewarding experience that I can't wait to play through again when they drop DLC.

#### Returnal

{% oglink url="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1649240/Returnal/" /%}

(I played this on PS5, but a PC port is coming soon)
This is an excellent roguelike. It's challenging, the story is compelling, and the gameplay feels tight and rewarding.
If you like sci-fi and gorgeous environmental roguelikes, you'll love this game.
It's marketed in such a way that it looks like a horror game, but it's not.
There are some horror elements, but it's really not scary and is entirely focused on fast-paced gunplay and exploration.

## Conclusion
That's it for 2022. I'm looking forward to 2023 and all the new things that will come with it.
