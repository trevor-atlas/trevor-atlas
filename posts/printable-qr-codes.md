 Just before Covid-19 took over the world, while checking out [Vercel
 ]() serverless functions I decided to create a QR code API. While it was a fun way to learn about Vercel and see how their infrastructure
  works, I was having a hard time thinking of much you can do with it.

Then I remembered that QR codes can contain wifi information for your phone! So I set about
 creating an easy way to connect people to the wifi in my house without having to remember a
  password, or explain capital vs lower case characters.
